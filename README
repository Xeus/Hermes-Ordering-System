Hermes Ordering System
Ben Turner

Final project for Chris Kairalla's Redial class at NYU-ITP, spring 2012.

Menu system using Node.js, MongoDB, jQuery.  Customers at bars, restaurants, whatever dial in to the phone number on a screen or on a table to make their orders, play trivia, read the news, or be social with other tables/stations nearby.

The phone as a remote instead of relying on touchscreens.

Best part?  Everyone's orders are broken up for everyone to pay separately.

Last update 22 Apr 12:  First up of git repo.  Been working on smartening up the design of the navigation so that it's more modular.

Search for "TODO:" to find things requiring more work/fixes.
